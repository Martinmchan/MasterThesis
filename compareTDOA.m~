%-------------- 1 m betweeen microphones ----------------------------%
%First test is when the sound source is closer to the microphones, approx
%1m

mic2 = '000103_244_mono2.wav'; %mic2 is the microphone closest to the sound source

%Second test is when the sound source is further away from the microphones,
%approx 2m
mic1 = '000103_245_mono1.wav'; 
mic2 = '000103_245_mono2.wav'; %mic2 is the microphone closest to the sound source

%Thrid test is when the sound source is even further away from the microphones,
%approx 3m

%First test is when the sound source is closer to the microphones, approx
%1m

%Second test is when the sound source is further away from the microphones,
%approx 2m

%-------------- 4 m betweeen microphones ----------------------------%
%Fourth test is when the sound source is closer to the microphones, approx

%approx 2m

%Sixth test is when the sound source is even further away from the microphones,
%approx 3m
